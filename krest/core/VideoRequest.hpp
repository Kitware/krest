  /// is useful in some situations since sources normally reply only to the
  /// most recent request. A negative value is "invalid"; if the identifier is
  /// negative, the source will reuse the most recent non-negative identifier
  /// when replying. Additionally, if a request cannot be satisfied, the source
  /// will only issue a response if the outstanding request identifier is
