  /// on a request with a non-negative request identifier.

  /// executing.

  ///   It is safe to call this method more than once. Because failing to call
  ///   this method is very likely to cause the program to crash or otherwise
  ///   fall into the Dread Realm of Undefined Behavior, the base class
  ///   attempts to detect such failure and will issue a fatal program error in
